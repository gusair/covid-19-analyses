The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, reshaped the world in unprecedented ways, affecting every aspect of society, from healthcare systems to global economies. This project delves into the extensive dataset provided by Our World in Data to analyze the global impact of the pandemic. By examining key metrics such as total cases, deaths, mortality rates, and vaccination progress, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that highlight the varying responses and outcomes across different countries. The dataset, comprising over 460,000 entries and 61 variables, offers a rich opportunity to explore the pandemic's evolution, identify the most affected regions, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

Through this analysis, we explore critical questions: Which countries were hit the hardest by COVID-19? How did mortality rates vary across regions, and what factors contributed to these differences? What role did vaccination campaigns play in stabilizing the pandemic? By visualizing the data and comparing trends over time, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's global impact. This project not only serves as a retrospective analysis but also offers valuable lessons for future public health crises. The findings underscore the importance of timely interventions, equitable healthcare access, and global cooperation in combating such unprecedented challenges.
